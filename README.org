* RAUKF applied to SINGLE OLM Model

Thsi repository contains the code used in [CITATION] in order to
produce the RAUKF results.

~:warning:~ Prior to running either of the python files provided you must ensure
that the =requirements.txt= is used to install python modules, as well
that the respective NEURON =.mod= files are compiled prior to
usage. Steps to do so are provided below:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ./multicompartment
nrnivmodl
cd ..
cd ./comp_opt_essential
nrnivmodl
cd ..
#+end_src

After doing so you can run the code residing within
=main.py= and =Plot_Comparison.py=.
